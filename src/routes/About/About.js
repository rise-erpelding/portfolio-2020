        I have been fascinated by web design since I realized that I could use HTML to change the design of my blog in high school. In the years since, as I became a teacher and instructional designer, I found that in my projects there was usually something I was hoping to customize, something more I was wanting to build to make my idea work, and that coding was the best way to accomplish it. Now, my dream is to help other people make their ideas come to life.

        If I won the lottery, Iâ€™d probably spend (some of) the money on learning something new. I love taking classes and learning new things, and some of my learning endeavors over the years (aside from learning to code) have included math, Spanish, Japanese, and sewing.

        My other interests include fitness and nutrition, cooking, and cookie-decorating. As an adult, I have called Hawaii, Oregon, Canada, Japan, Florida, and New Mexico home. I currently live in beautiful Destin, Florida, where I am a proud military spouse and mom of two.
